Got it — this whole breakdown needs to be fixed and systematically hardened. Let’s walk the Replit Agent through the **precise fix path** for the missing company selection during dispatch creation (which caused `400 "Tenant not found"`), and also **enforce system-wide discipline** for future-proofing dispatch behavior.

---

## 🛠️ PROMPT FOR REPLIT AGENT — FIX DISPATCH CREATION + ENFORCE TENANT CONTEXT

### 🔧 CONTEXT

Dispatches are **always created for a specific company (tenant)**. But right now, the `Create Dispatch` modal is **missing the tenant selector field**, which leads to backend errors like:

```json
400 { "message": "Tenant not found" }
```

This breaks the core flow. We need to **restore the tenant selection**, validate that it’s **required**, and **pass the correct tenantId** to the backend on submit.

---

### ✅ PRIMARY OBJECTIVE

Update the **Create Dispatch** modal and logic so that:

* ✅ A company (tenant) must be selected before creating a dispatch
* ✅ The tenant ID is properly sent to `/api/dispatches`
* ✅ Error handling is improved (show helpful message if tenant is missing)
* ✅ Any removed logic is restored (like pre-populating tenant list in dropdown)

---

### 📍 FILE & ROUTE TARGETS

#### 1. `client/src/pages/dispatches.tsx`

* Confirm this is the file where `<CreateDispatchModal />` is called.
* Ensure correct props are passed if tenant ID is scoped earlier (e.g. from company view).

#### 2. `client/src/components/dispatches/create-dispatch.tsx`

* 🧠 **Add a new dropdown** for Tenant/Company selection

  * Fetch tenants via `/api/tenants`
  * Display `name` but submit `id`
* 🧠 Update form validation: Make `tenantId` required
* 🧠 Submit form payload with all required fields:

  ```ts
  {
    name,
    courseId,
    tenantId,
    maxUsers,
    maxCompletions,
    expiresAt
  }
  ```
* 🧠 Add a clear error toast if `tenantId` is missing or API fails

#### 3. `server/routes/dispatches.ts`

* ✅ Already validates `tenantId`, which is good.
* 🔍 Confirm `findActiveDispatch()` logic works correctly when `tenantId` is now properly passed.

---

### 🧩 UX LOGIC CONSIDERATIONS

* If coming **from a specific company page**, you may want to preselect the tenant in the dropdown.
* If coming from global dispatch page, tenant field must be **mandatory and visible**.
* Add a comment: `// Dispatches must always be scoped to a tenant.`

---

### 🔁 SYSTEM-WIDE INTEGRITY HOOK

✅ After fix is applied:

* 🔍 **Check all references to Create Dispatch modal** — make sure nothing bypasses the tenant requirement.
* 🔍 Confirm new dispatches **appear correctly under their companies** in `/admin/companies/[id].tsx`
* 🔍 Confirm all analytics, dashboard stats, and audit trails link back to the right tenant.

---

### 💬 TOAST/ERROR MESSAGE

```ts
toast.error("You must select a company before creating a dispatch.")
```

---

### 🔒 FUTURE PREVENTION

As a discipline rule, **no dispatch should exist without a tenant.** Enforce this with:

* Required field in frontend form
* Required validation in backend API
* Filtering logic everywhere to group dispatches by tenant
