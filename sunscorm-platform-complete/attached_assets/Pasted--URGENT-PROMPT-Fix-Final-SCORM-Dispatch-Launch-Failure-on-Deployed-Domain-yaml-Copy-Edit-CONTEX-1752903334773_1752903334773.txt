✅ URGENT PROMPT: Fix Final SCORM Dispatch Launch Failure on Deployed Domain

🧠 CONTEXT:
We're fully deployed at:  
🔗 https://sun-scorm-manager-dscalessa1010.replit.app

We are trying to launch a SCORM dispatch ZIP in TalentLMS using that live domain.

The loader initializes and injects this launch URL:

🔗 https://sun-scorm-manager-dscalessa1010.replit.app/launch/d5713e8d-39f0-4ccb-9b03-0d7cb4749ef3

But it **fails to open** with the following console errors:

❌ `Invalid launch URL detected`
❌ `Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'launch_url')`
❌ `Fallback triggered: Redirect may have failed, showing manual launch option`

---

### 🚨 WHAT TO FIX RIGHT NOW

#### ✅ 1. **Stop Referencing `scorm_loaderV2.html`**
- This file is **still in the exported ZIP**, and it’s causing the launch_url error via postMessage fallback.
- We **no longer use postMessage.** All launch_url values are injected at build time now.
- **Delete this file from the dispatch package generation step**
- All logic should rely exclusively on the new `index.html` that already has `launch_url` baked in.

#### ✅ 2. **Ensure Only `index.html` Is the SCORM Entrypoint**
- Confirm that:
  - `imsmanifest.xml` references `index.html` as the launch file
  - No loaderV2 files are referenced or zipped
  - `index.html` correctly includes `launch_url` as a variable **not undefined**
- Inject launch URL **as a string in a `<script>` tag or variable** like:

```js
const LAUNCH_URL = "https://sun-scorm-manager-dscalessa1010.replit.app/launch/<token>";
Make sure the HTML uses that constant directly.

✅ 3. Fix Index.html Logic for Invalid Launch
The message “Invalid launch URL” is being triggered by a guard clause in index.html:181.

Update that clause to only fire if the URL is missing or malformed.

Do not trigger fallback just because it isn’t localhost or Replit dev — this is now the valid production domain.

✅ Example:

js
Copy
Edit
if (!launchUrl || !launchUrl.startsWith("https://")) {
  showManualLaunchOption();
  return;
}
window.location.href = launchUrl;
🧪 CONFIRMATION CHECKLIST (After Fix Is Applied)
✅ SCORM ZIP only includes index.html as the entry point

✅ No scorm_loaderV2.html in ZIP

✅ index.html has valid launchUrl injected directly in code

✅ Launch URL works inside TalentLMS (no “invalid” message or postMessage fallback)

✅ Course fully loads and plays with no console errors

💡 Reminder
We're now deployed. Stop referencing preview server URLs in any part of the app or export logic. Use only:

This is what LMS platforms will expect — and it works.
