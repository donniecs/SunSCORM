Based on everything we now know â€” from the security hardening âœ… to the dispatch audit âœ… to the QA review âœ… â€” here is the **most important next step** to get your platform fully up and running for *real-world external LMS testing*:

## ðŸ”‘ NEXT STEP: **Generate `launch.html` Files Per Dispatch for LMS Upload**

### ðŸŽ¯ WHY THIS IS MISSION-CRITICAL:

This is the **final handoff file** you upload into external LMS platforms like **TalentLMS**, **Docebo**, **Cornerstone**, etc.

Without it, you canâ€™t:

* Test dispatch delivery
* Validate token flow from an external system
* Prove SCORM launch + tracking works outside your environment

---

## âœ… ACTIONS NEEDED IN THIS PHASE:

1. When a dispatch is created, generate a `launch.html` file
2. The HTML will **auto-redirect to** `/launch/:token` on your domain
3. Save the file to `uploads/launch_links/dispatch-{id}.html`
4. Offer a **download button** in the admin dashboard
5. This file is what you upload to **external LMS platforms** as your course

ðŸŽ¯ PHASE 13D.2 â€” SCORM Dispatch Export File Generation

Your task is to generate a `launch.html` file for every SCORM dispatch, so it can be uploaded to external LMS systems (like TalentLMS) to trigger the correct SCORM launch flow.

You are a senior engineer. Do NOT scaffold new apps, create random folders, or generate new routing logic. Follow these steps precisely.

---

âœ… STEP 1: Locate dispatch creation logic  
- File: `server/routes.ts` (POST `/api/dispatches`)
- Confirm where the dispatch object is created
- After successful creation, generate a file with this structure:

```

<!DOCTYPE html>

<html>
  <head>
    <meta http-equiv="refresh" content="0; url=https://{PUBLIC_DOMAIN}/launch/{token}" />
    <title>Loading Course...</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>If you are not redirected, <a href="https://{PUBLIC_DOMAIN}/launch/{token}">click here</a>.</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

Replace `{token}` with the actual dispatch launch token
Replace `{PUBLIC_DOMAIN}` with `process.env.PUBLIC_DOMAIN` (add it to `.env` if missing)

---

âœ… STEP 2: Save the file

* File path: `uploads/launch_links/dispatch-{dispatchId}.html`
* Create `uploads/launch_links/` directory if it doesn't exist
* Use `fs.writeFileSync` or equivalent
* If `uploads/` is already used for SCORMs, this folder can live under it

---

âœ… STEP 3: Confirm admin can download the file

* Add a new GET API route: `GET /api/dispatches/:id/launch-file`
* File: `server/routes.ts`
* Route should:

  * Validate user is admin
  * Validate dispatch exists
  * Read the file and send as `res.download(...)`

---

ðŸ“‹ Final output should include:

* Launch HTML file saved with correct dispatch token
* New GET route for downloading the launch file
* Summary of where you inserted logic and what was created

---

ðŸ›‘ DO NOT:

* Generate frontend buttons
* Scaffold a UI
* Modify unrelated routes
* Use placeholder tokens or fake IDs â€” use the real dispatch data

Wait for review before proceeding to UI download button or LMS upload tests.

```

---

Once this runs and we have a working downloadable `launch.html`, youâ€™ll be able to:

âœ… Upload it into TalentLMS  
âœ… Trigger a real SCORM launch  
âœ… Begin external validation  

Let me know when it's done and Iâ€™ll prep the follow-up prompt to wire the **admin download button** for this file.
```
