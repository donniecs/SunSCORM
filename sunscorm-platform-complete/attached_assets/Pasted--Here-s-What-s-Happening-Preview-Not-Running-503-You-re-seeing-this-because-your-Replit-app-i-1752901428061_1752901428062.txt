🧠 Here's What's Happening
⚠️ Preview Not Running (503)
You’re seeing this because your Replit app is sleeping when accessed externally. The screenshot that Agent took is from its own internal preview, not from a deployed public URL — and Replit doesn't automatically keep your app running externally unless:

You manually keep it awake with UptimeRobot or another ping service (not reliable long-term)

Or deploy it through Replit’s deployment system.

🛠️ Immediate Fix: Deploy the App Properly
Here’s how to make the site actually run outside of Replit's dev mode:

Go to your Replit project

On the sidebar, click “Deployments”

Choose “Static” or “Web Service” (you’re probably a Web Service)

Click “Create Deployment” (it might ask to auto-configure start and build scripts)

Copy the permanent URL once deployed — it will now always work externally

Update your SCORM loader templates to use this new deployed https://yoursite.replit.app/launch/... base URL

💥 This is why TalentLMS was seeing Invalid launch URL — it was trying to iframe a link to a dev-only preview server that shuts off.

🔥 And Let Me Write You the Next Task Prompt for Claude
This is exactly what the Agent needs to fix — and it needs to be scoped properly:

✅ CLAUDE PROMPT: Fix SCORM Launch URL and Deploy for Real

### TASK: Make SCORM Launch Links Functional in External LMSs (e.g., TalentLMS)

Our current SCORM dispatch system works well **inside Replit**, but **launch links break externally** because they point to a Replit preview domain that shuts down when idle.

### 🎯 GOAL

✅ Ensure every SCORM dispatch ZIP we export includes a `launch.html` file that:
- Works **when hosted externally**
- Launches the correct course
- Doesn’t rely on postMessage or broken preview servers

### 🧩 CONTEXT

We tested by uploading the SCORM export ZIP into **TalentLMS**. It tried to iframe the course and failed to load, because:
- `launch_url` was not properly set in the loader
- Replit’s app was not deployed, only running in dev mode
- The SCORM loader was looking for a variable that was never injected

### 🔧 WHAT TO FIX

1. **Replace postMessage system entirely**
   - Inject `launch_url` **at ZIP generation time** into the HTML file
   - Remove all usage of `scorm_loaderV2.html` that expects postMessage

2. **Deploy the Replit app as a live Web Service**
   - Use Replit's Deployment flow (Deployments tab)
   - Confirm launch URLs now point to `https://yoursite.replit.app/launch/:token` permanently

3. **Update SCORM loader HTML template**
   - Must be `index.html` in the ZIP
   - Include:
     - a loading screen
     - a `<script>` that automatically loads `launch_url`
     - fallback link if iframe fails

4. **Update dispatch ZIP generation**
   - Inject `launch_url` as a variable in `index.html`
   - Confirm directory structure works in all LMSs (e.g. TalentLMS, Moodle)

### ✅ DELIVERABLES

- Working SCORM package that loads in TalentLMS
- All launch URLs point to the **live deployed site**
- No more preview-only links
- Error handling and fallback added to index.html

### ⚠️ NOTE
Do **not** regenerate broken previews. This must be a systematic fix that works externally, not just inside Replit’s editor. Test the final ZIP in TalentLMS or export it and inspect the HTML manually.
🔁 Then You Can Test It Like This
After Claude finishes:

Download a dispatch ZIP

Open index.html in a text editor

Confirm it has an embedded link like:

html
Copy
Edit
const launch_url = "https://yourscormplatform.replit.app/launch/abc123";
Upload it into TalentLMS again

Confirm it actually opens and plays — no more "undefined launch_url" or 503s

🧨 Final Reminder
This is not optional — no SCORM platform can function without working ZIP dispatches. You’ve done everything right: built the dispatch system, upload logic, license limits — now it’s about executing the final 10%.

Let’s make this platform run like it’s meant to.
