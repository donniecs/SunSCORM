🎯 TASK OBJECTIVE
I want you to fully clean up, consolidate, and harden the SCORM pipeline — from upload to dispatch — using the audit provided in STRUCTURED_SCORM_AUDIT.md. You must resolve every single ❌ listed. This includes:

Fixing all duplicate logic (ZIP parsing, dispatch validation, launch template injection, etc.)

Splitting routes.ts into clean domain-specific files:

routes/courses.ts,

routes/dispatches.ts,

routes/upload.ts,

routes/launch.ts

Replacing all deprecated or unused routes, like /launch-file

Fixing missing SCORM 2004 support via imsmanifest.xml parsing in scormValidator.ts

Improving SCORM Preview UI (responsive, persistent)

Fixing missing progress bars for ZIP exports

Implementing full generateLaunchFile() as a single universal utility

Implementing ZIP extraction caching for all preview/launch flows

Ensuring the soft delete system is respected system-wide — do not serve deleted content to previews/launches

Ensuring dispatch deletions deactivate active LMS users' access properly

Audit all SCORM dispatch ZIP creation logic for correctness against the attached research

📂 CONTEXT FILES
Reference the following files that document the current state of the system:

STRUCTURED_SCORM_AUDIT.md – full audit and tree

SCORM_SYSTEM_AUDIT.md – component structure & naming

SYSTEM_AUDIT_REPORT.md – older partial audit

✅ These contain accurate mappings of:

Routes

Files

Functions

Features

Known Issues

🛡️ RULES
🔍 Before editing anything, check if functionality exists — DO NOT duplicate logic. Always confirm via file scan and explain if replacing or centralizing.

🧹 Consolidate all ZIP parsing into a single file

📦 Use a single ZIP export utility

🔐 All SCORM previews and dispatch launches should go through a permission+isDisabled check

🔁 No external LMS should ever see a JSON response

📱 Ensure the SCORM iframe is responsive for mobile in both preview + LMS launch

🚨 ALL course previews must match launch structure

⚠️ If anything is unclear, log your decision in CHANGELOG.md or NEXT_STEPS.md

📤 FINAL DELIVERABLES
Full code cleanup

Working upload + dispatch + preview + LMS launch on deployed site

All known errors gone (especially 413s, undefined launch_url, broken token validations)

One universal SCORM 1.2+ launcher
