Here is your **industry-grade prompt** rewritten to fully match your lead dev standards — with **explicit direction**, **preservation of existing components**, **rationale behind each instruction**, and **scoping Claude like a senior engineer would**:

### ✅ CLAUDE TASK: Implement Full Company Profile View

🎯 **Objective:**
Upgrade the Companies module to support a full, scoped profile page per company. This will allow admins to see a complete breakdown of each tenant’s stats, assigned courses, and dispatch records — without removing or replacing the existing quick-access card tools like **View Dispatches** and **License Settings**.

---

### 🧠 Why This Matters:

* **Visibility:** Admins need a full breakdown of what each company has access to — not just summary cards.
* **Functionality:** This view enables audit-level clarity on licenses and usage.
* **Scalability:** We’re preparing for Phase 14, where dispatches will be exported to external LMSs — having a per-company view is a foundational UI step.

---

### 🛠️ Implementation Instructions

#### 1. 🛤️ **New Route/Page**

* Create a **new route**:

  ```
  /admin/companies/[companyId].tsx
  ```
* This should be a standalone full-page view.
* Clicking **“View”** or **“Manage”** on a company card should link to this page with the correct ID passed via router param.

> 🧠 **Important**: Do **not** remove or refactor the company card modals (`View Dispatches`, `License Settings`). These are quick-access tools that should remain. This new page is a deep-dive alternative view.

---

#### 2. 📊 **Data Loading**

You must fetch data from **three sources**:

* `GET /api/tenants/:id` → Company info
* `GET /api/dispatches?tenantId=...` → All dispatches for the company
* `GET /api/courses` → Master list of courses (to resolve `courseId → title`)

Implement proper **loading state** (e.g. spinner or skeleton) while this data loads.

---

#### 3. 🧩 **Page Layout**

Break the page into the following three sections:

##### 🟦 Section 1: Company Overview

* Display:

  * Company Name
  * ID
  * Creation Date
  * Count of assigned dispatches

##### 🟨 Section 2: Assigned Courses

* **Derive this from the dispatch list**.
* For each dispatch, cross-reference `courseId` with the master course list to get the title.
* Show:

  * Course title
  * Assigned date (createdAt)
  * Expiration date
  * Max users
* Display these in a **list or card format** — not a table.

##### 🟥 Section 3: Raw Dispatch Table

* Tabular view of every dispatch for the company.
* Columns:

  * Dispatch UUID
  * Course title (resolved from courseId)
  * Created At
  * Expires At
  * Max Users

---

### 🔒 UX Rules

* “View Dispatches” and “License Settings” should **stay on the card** on `/admin/companies` — we’re adding, not replacing.
* The card’s “View” or “Manage” button should `router.push()` to this new profile page.
* Include a “Back to Companies” link or breadcrumb on the detail view.

---

### 📁 File Targets

* New file: `apps/web/app/admin/companies/[companyId].tsx`
* Shared logic can go into a new helper file if needed (e.g. `utils/companyDispatchHelpers.ts`)

---

### 🔍 Final Checks

✅ Existing cards must remain untouched
✅ All dispatches must match tenantId from URL
✅ Course titles must be resolved from courseId
✅ No dummy data or unlinked fields
