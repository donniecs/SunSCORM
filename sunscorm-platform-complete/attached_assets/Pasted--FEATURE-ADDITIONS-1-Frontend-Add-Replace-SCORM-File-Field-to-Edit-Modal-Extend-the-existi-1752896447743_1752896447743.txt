🧩 FEATURE ADDITIONS
📁 1. [Frontend] Add "Replace SCORM File" Field to Edit Modal
Extend the existing course edit modal (already present, confirmed) with:

A new file upload field:

vbnet
Copy
Edit
Label: Replace SCORM File (optional)
Type: file (.zip)
It should only allow .zip, and replace the previous SCORM file if a new one is uploaded

Clearly display:

“Uploading a new file will overwrite the current SCORM package for this course across all dispatches.”

🧠 2. [Backend] Replace Stored File Logic
When a SCORM file is included in the update:

Use existing SCORM processing logic (from course upload)

Replace the stored file (storage location, database pointer, and parsed manifest)

File storage path must remain stable, e.g.:
/uploads/courses/{courseId}/scorm.zip

Overwriting ensures that existing dispatches point to the updated file automatically

🔁 3. [Dispatch Consistency Behavior]
All past and future dispatches that point to courseId=X should:

Immediately use the new SCORM file after update

There should be no need to re-dispatch if file is changed

Keep the courseId → file mapping centralized

🛑 Edge Cases to Handle
Case	Behavior
Admin edits metadata only	No file overwrite happens
Admin uploads new .zip	Old one is replaced, database updated
Invalid .zip	Reject and toast error
Dispatches exist	They now serve the updated file
Course is new	No overwrite logic needed (already handled by uploader)

✅ UX Requirements
Form validation for .zip only

Show a status toast:

“Course updated — new file uploaded successfully.”

or “Course updated — no file change.”

Keep the flow seamless — the admin should not need to re-assign anything

🚫 DO NOT:
Do not create a new course record — this is a replacement

Do not mutate dispatch records — they should be unaffected

Do not allow non-zip files to be uploaded

Do not duplicate storage paths — overwrite cleanly

🧪 Testing Checklist
Action	Expected Outcome
Upload new SCORM zip	Old file gone, dispatches use new one
No file uploaded	Only metadata updates
Click “Download Launch File” in company view	Serves updated content
Try to upload non-zip	Error toast, no update happens
Upload malformed zip	Error toast from SCORM parser
