## 🚨 Current Problem:

```
index.html:171 Launching course: https://yourscormplatform.replit.app/launch/ce3f9d9d-2350-4556-acbd-2ff227c88246  
index.html:175 Invalid launch URL  
```

This confirms:

* ✅ The loader is **finding the launch URL**
* ❌ But it’s a placeholder: `https://yourscormplatform.replit.app/...`
* 🔥 Meaning: **the Replit Agent is still injecting a dummy string**, not the real environment-based domain

---

## ✅ What to Fix Now (Final Steps):

You need to **patch the backend ZIP builder** to dynamically inject the **correct public base URL** (your Replit app's actual domain) instead of that fake placeholder.

Here’s the **exact next prompt** to send to the Replit agent:

### 🛠 PATCH: Inject Real Hostname in SCORM Dispatch ZIP Loader

Our new SCORM dispatch ZIP now uses `server/templates/scorm-loader.html`, and the loader works beautifully in LMS environments.

However, it currently injects a hardcoded launch URL like:

```
https://yourscormplatform.replit.app/launch/:token
```

We need to dynamically inject the **correct base URL** from the current environment (Replit hostname) into the dispatch ZIP at generation time.

---

#### ✅ Required Fixes:

1. **Update ZIP Generation Logic**

In the file that builds the ZIP archive (likely `generateDispatchZip.ts` or equivalent), find where you're doing:

```ts
const launchUrl = `https://yourscormplatform.replit.app/launch/${dispatch.launchToken}`;
```

Replace this with something like:

```ts
const baseUrl = process.env.PUBLIC_APP_URL || "https://fallback-url.com";
const launchUrl = `${baseUrl}/launch/${dispatch.launchToken}`;
```

> ✅ If `PUBLIC_APP_URL` is not set, fallback to a placeholder and log a warning.

---

2. **Set the Environment Variable (Optional, but Ideal)**

In `.env` or Replit Secrets:

```
PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://your-actual-replit-url.replit.app
```

This allows the ZIP generation to always inject the correct `launch_url`, even in dev or prod.

---

3. **Validate That Placeholder is Gone**

After rebuilding a dispatch:

* Open the new ZIP
* Open `index.html` (or `scorm_loader.html`)
* Check the string `launch_url = "..."` — make sure it’s using your real domain
* Reupload to TalentLMS and it should **fully launch the SCORM course**

---

#### 🔒 Bonus (Prevent This in Future):

✅ Add a check that throws an error if the string `yourscormplatform.replit.app` ever appears in the final ZIP — that way you don’t accidentally publish broken dispatches.

---

Once you’ve run that, upload a fresh dispatch ZIP and try again. The course should launch clean.
