🚨 PROBLEM
When you try to dispatch a course to a company that already had a dispatch for that course (even if disabled), it throws this:

json
Copy
Edit
409 Conflict: "Dispatch already exists for this course and company"
This should never happen for disabled dispatches. If it’s soft-deleted, it becomes a receipt, not a blocker.

✅ OBJECTIVE — SYSTEMATIC BEHAVIOR
“Disabled dispatches should never block a new dispatch. They are just audit trail receipts.”

🧠 WHAT TO CHANGE
🧩 1. findActiveDispatch() — FIX THE SOURCE
📄 server/lib/dispatches/findActiveDispatch.ts or equivalent utility

🔧 Change this function to only check for non-disabled dispatches:

ts
Copy
Edit
where: {
  tenantId,
  courseId,
  isDisabled: false // 🔥 This line is the key
}
🔐 This is what’s triggering the 409 conflict — it’s checking everything instead of just active ones.

📡 2. /api/dispatches POST Route
📄 server/routes/dispatches.ts

🧼 Clean up logic that throws 409 if the above findActiveDispatch() returns anything.

✅ After fix, this should only prevent exact duplicates of active dispatches.

ts
Copy
Edit
const existing = await findActiveDispatch(...);
if (existing) {
  return res.status(409).json({ message: "Dispatch already exists for this course and company" });
}
🧠 But now this will only fire for non-disabled (which is good).

🧾 3. Company Profile View (company-profile.tsx or similar)
📄 client/src/pages/companies/[id].tsx or equivalent

✅ Continue to show disabled dispatches in the company’s “Dispatch History” tab

🧩 For each, show:

Dispatch name

Course title

Date created / date disabled

Limit settings (maxUsers, maxCompletions, expiresAt)

Status: ✅ Active / 🧾 Disabled

🧠 Disabled dispatches become permanent receipts, never blockers

🧑‍💻 4. Create Dispatch Modal UX (Optional)
📄 create-dispatch.tsx

🧠 (Optional but nice): Add a passive banner or info pill if the tenant had an old disabled dispatch of that course:

“⚠️ This course was previously dispatched to this company but is now disabled. You may re-dispatch it.”

🧷 SANITY CHECK
✅ Dispatches are uniquely scoped by:

ts
Copy
Edit
tenantId + courseId + isDisabled = false
👎 tenantId + courseId alone is not enough — it breaks reusability.

🧱 ENFORCEMENT COMMENTS (Add to File Headers)
ts
Copy
Edit
// NOTE: Disabled dispatches do not block new dispatches. They act only as historical receipts.
// Only active (non-disabled) dispatches are used in uniqueness checks.
🧪 AFTER THIS FIX
✅ You can re-dispatch the same course to the same company as many times as you want (as long as prior one is disabled)

✅ Old dispatch shows up as history on company page

✅ Conflict only happens if you're trying to dispatch something that is already live for that company
