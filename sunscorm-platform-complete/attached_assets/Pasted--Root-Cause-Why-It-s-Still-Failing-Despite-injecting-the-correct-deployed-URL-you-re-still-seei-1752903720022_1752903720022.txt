🧠 Root Cause (Why It’s Still Failing)
Despite injecting the correct deployed URL, you’re still seeing:

mathematica
Copy
Edit
Invalid launch URL detected
{ "message": "Invalid Token" }
That means the launch file was successfully embedded into the LMS and attempted to hit your deployed /launch/:token route — but:

🔥 The token no longer exists or was never correctly registered.
Most likely because:

⚠️ The dispatch entry was created during preview mode, not production — and tokens generated then were not synced after deployment

⚠️ The /launch/:token route in production is rejecting it because it doesn’t match anything in your live database

⚠️ The ZIP still contains an outdated launch_url pointing to a token that isn’t active or was generated from a dev server run

🛠️ Fix: Full Production-Synced Dispatch Flow
Let’s walk Claude through exactly what must happen to repair this — permanently. Use the following detailed scoped prompt:

✅ Claude Prompt (SCORM Dispatch Fix — Final Production Sync)
📂 PATH CONTEXT

Loader Template: /server/templates/scorm-loader.html

SCORM ZIP Generator: /server/routes.ts → inside res.download(...) logic for dispatch route

Token Generation: /server/controllers/dispatchController.ts

Launch Route: /server/routes/launch.ts

Env: .env should contain BASE_URL=https://sun-scorm-manager-dscalessa1010.replit.app

🧭 TASK OBJECTIVE
Ensure all future SCORM dispatch ZIPs contain a valid, working launch_url that:

Uses the deployed production domain (.replit.app)

Points to an active, valid launch token

Loads and plays the SCORM course in LMS environments like TalentLMS without failure

📌 FIX THIS SYSTEMATICALLY:
💾 Inject Real-Time Token at Export

When generating a ZIP for a dispatch, create a new launch token

Save that token to the database as a valid DispatchUser entry (if it isn’t already created)

Inject it into the index.html of the loader using:

ts
Copy
Edit
const launchUrl = `${process.env.BASE_URL}/launch/${token}`
📁 Verify /launch/:token Works in Deployed App

The deployed endpoint must be reachable externally

If the token is valid, it should return the correct SCORM player and assets

🧼 Delete Old scorm_loaderV2.html

It still tries to read launch_url via postMessage — remove it entirely

Replace with scorm-loader.html only (Claude created it already)

✅ Validate Full Dispatch Flow

Trigger a new dispatch via admin UI

Download the ZIP

Upload to TalentLMS

Launch it — verify it works without fallback/manual launch

🧪 Test Plan (Claude Should Do This)
 ✅ Run npm run start on deployed Replit app

 ✅ From admin panel, dispatch a course to a company

 ✅ Download the new SCORM ZIP

 ✅ Upload it to TalentLMS

 ✅ Verify it launches and plays without fallback message

 ✅ Log any 403 or 404s to troubleshoot token lookups

🎯 Success Criteria
Check	Result
ZIP includes deployed launch URL	✅
Token in URL is valid in production DB	✅
Loader uses injected launch URL only	✅
SCORM course plays in LMS	✅
No fallback/manual trigger needed	✅
