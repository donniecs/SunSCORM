Crystal clear — and yes, this is a **core platform milestone.** You're describing the need to implement **course-to-company assignment** (dispatch provisioning) via a **multi-course selection interface**, with full company-specific visibility.

You're about to build what SCORM Cloud calls a **“course license relationship manager.”**

## 🎯 GOAL: Assign Courses to a Company (via Dispatches)

> So admins can:

* Select multiple courses
* Assign them to a company
* Define limits (max users, expiration)
* View all dispatches per company in the org dashboard

---

## ✅ You already have:

* Courses uploaded and listed
* Tenants (companies) created
* Dispatch creation logic
* License fields per dispatch
* Admin UI with both `/courses` and `/companies` pages

---

## 🔧 WHAT NEEDS TO BE BUILT NEXT (Architected Plan)

### ✅ PHASE 13D.3 – Course Assignment Flow via Dispatch

---

### 👷 BACKEND WORK (if needed — Agent will confirm first):

We may already have:

* `POST /api/dispatches` – accepts courseId + tenantId
* `GET /api/dispatches?tenantId=X` – may exist, or we create it
* All schema support for dispatch records

So most work will be **UI wiring** — not new backend.

🎯 PHASE 13D.3 – Course-to-Company Assignment Flow (Dispatch Provisioning)

You are a senior engineer finalizing the enterprise SCORM dispatch system.  
Your task is to enable admins to assign multiple courses to a specific company (tenant), creating dispatches in bulk via the UI.

---

✅ STEP 1: COURSE SELECTION UI

In the `/courses` page, add:
- A checkbox next to each course
- A "Bulk Assign" button at the top or bottom of the course list

On click:
- Open a modal: "Assign selected courses to a company"
- Modal includes:
  - Dropdown to select a company (tenant)
  - Expiration date field
  - Max users input

Submit button creates a dispatch for each selected course using:
- `POST /api/dispatches`
- Pass: `courseId`, `tenantId`, `expiresAt`, `maxUsers`

✅ IMPORTANT:
- Do not duplicate any dispatches if they already exist for that course+tenant combo (check before creating)
- Use TanStack Query mutations if possible

---

✅ STEP 2: VIEW ASSIGNED COURSES PER COMPANY

In the `/companies` page:
- Make each row (or "View" button) open a Company Detail view or modal
- This view should list all dispatches for that company:
  - Course name
  - Expiration date
  - Max users
  - Launch link (optional)
  - Usage summary (optional for now)

Fetch using:
- `GET /api/dispatches?tenantId=XYZ` — use this if it exists
- If not: implement new route in `routes.ts` that filters dispatches by tenant

---

📦 OUTPUT I EXPECT:

```

✅ PHASE 13D.3 COMPLETE:

* \[UI] Checkboxes and Bulk Assign modal added to /courses
* \[UI] Company view now shows all dispatches per company
* \[API] Existing POST /api/dispatches used with courseId+tenantId
* \[Logic] Prevented duplicate dispatches per course+tenant
* \[UX] Admin can now assign multiple courses to any company easily

```

🛑 DO NOT:
- Scaffold new pages unnecessarily
- Create new course or tenant tables
- Rewrite dispatch logic — just reuse what exists

Wait for review before continuing to launch testing.
```

---

Once this is working, you’ll be able to:

✅ Assign multiple courses to any tenant (company I want all tenant stuff to be renamed to companies/company which ever already exists and rerouted to only be companies/company)
✅ View a company’s licensed catalog
✅ Maintain dispatch-level enforcement
✅ Prep for launch link generation + LMS uploads
