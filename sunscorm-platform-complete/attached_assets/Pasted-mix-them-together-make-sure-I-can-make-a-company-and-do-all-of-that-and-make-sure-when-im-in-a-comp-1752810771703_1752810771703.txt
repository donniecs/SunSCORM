mix them together, make sure I can make a company and do all of that and make sure when im in a company and I dispatch that company a course I can chaange it per course! the header is fine for now not worried about that, but this below.

I need to enhance the dispatch creation functionality with additional license enforcement options. Currently, we only have "Max Users" and "Expiration Date" in the Create Dispatch modal, but I need to implement a more comprehensive licensing system.

Please add these additional constraint options:
1. Maximum Completions - Total number of times a course can be completed across all users
2. Maximum Unique Users - Similar to current "Max Users" but ensure it's tracking unique individuals
3. Expiration Date - Already implemented

These constraints should work in ANY combination:
- Users should be able to enable just one constraint
- Users should be able to enable any two constraints together
- Users should be able to enable all three constraints simultaneously

Important implementation requirements:
1. First check if this functionality already exists partially in the codebase
2. Update database schema if needed to store these constraints
3. Modify API endpoints to validate against all constraint types
4. Update the frontend dispatch creation form
5. Ensure validation logic checks ALL enabled constraints before allowing access
6. Update any existing dashboard analytics to reflect these constraints

The changes should be integrated across the entire application flow:
- Database models
- API validation middleware
- Frontend components
- Analytics tracking

Please ensure the solution is cohesive and not just an isolated feature!

I need to enhance our license enforcement system to work at both the dispatch and company levels. Let me explain the complete requirements:

1. DISPATCH LEVEL ENFORCEMENT:
   - Add "Maximum Completions" option to the Create Dispatch modal (along with existing Max Users and Expiration Date)
   - Allow any combination of these three constraints on individual dispatches

2. COMPANY LEVEL ENFORCEMENT (NEW):
   - Implement the same three enforcement options on the company/tenant level
   - These settings should be accessible from the Company management page
   - Company-level enforcement settings MUST OVERRIDE any individual dispatch settings

3. ENFORCEMENT HIERARCHY:
   - If a company has a limit of 50 completions, it applies across ALL dispatches for that company
   - If a company has an expiration date of July 1st, ALL dispatches for that company expire on that date regardless of their individual settings
   - The most restrictive setting from the company level should always take precedence

Please ensure this is fully integrated throughout the system:
1. Check if parts of this functionality already exist in the codebase
2. Update database schemas for both dispatches and companies
3. Modify ALL relevant API endpoints to check company-level constraints first
4. Update both dispatch creation and company management UI
5. Ensure validation logic enforces the hierarchy correctly
6. Update analytics to show limits at both levels

This feature needs complete end-to-end implementation, not just UI changes.
