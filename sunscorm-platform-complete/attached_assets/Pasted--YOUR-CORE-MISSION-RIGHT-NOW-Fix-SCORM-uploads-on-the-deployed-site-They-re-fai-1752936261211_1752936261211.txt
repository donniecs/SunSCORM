# 🧠 YOUR CORE MISSION RIGHT NOW

**Fix SCORM uploads on the deployed site.** They’re failing with `413 Payload Too Large`. This blocks testing, dispatching, and core SCORM functionality. **Fix this FIRST or nothing else matters.**

---

# 📦 WHAT’S BROKEN?

Uploading a SCORM `.zip` file (e.g., 220MB) on your deployed Replit instance gives:

```http
413 Payload Too Large
```

Even though the progress bar goes to 100%, the backend crashes the request due to a hard-coded size limit.

# 🎯 WHAT WE NEED TO DO (COMMANDS TO REPLIT AGENT)

## ✅ Ask the Agent This, Word for Word:

```md
🔧 Fix SCORM Uploads — 413 Payload Too Large

We are running a SCORM dispatch platform (Sun-SCORM). On the deployed domain, uploading a large `.zip` SCORM course (200MB–400MB) fails with:

```

POST /api/courses/upload → 413 Payload Too Large

```

✅ Fix This System-Wide:
1. Increase file size limits in `multer` (or whatever middleware handles uploads) to **at least 512MB**
2. Ensure Express has `limit` config: `express.json({ limit: '512mb' })`
3. Confirm you're NOT using `bodyParser.json()` for file uploads — that breaks it
4. Ensure the Replit Web Service deployment accepts large payloads (no internal caps)
5. Test upload end-to-end in deployed domain (not just locally)

📁 Path of Concern:
- `/api/courses/upload` (backend route)
- File goes to `/uploads` folder
- `imsmanifest.xml` is extracted and parsed — make sure this logic is untouched

🧪 Final Test:
- Upload a 250MB+ SCORM `.zip`
- Confirm upload succeeds
- Course appears in admin dashboard
- Preview launches and loads normally

🎯 This is urgent — this feature is blocking all dispatch and LMS testing.

```

# 🧱 FILES LIKELY TO BE INVOLVED

Your Replit Agent will need to check and fix:

* `server/routes/courses.ts` or `courses.js`
* Any config to `multer` or `express-fileupload`
* Replit deployment config (Web Service mode, `replit.nix` if using custom RAM)

---

# 🧠 AFTER THIS IS FIXED

Once this is resolved, the next three steps will be:

1. ✅ **Add Preview SCORM on Site** — Let admin run SCORM in-course page to confirm it’s working before dispatching.
2. ✅ **Add Systematic Delete** — Allow deleting courses without wiping dispatch history.
3. ✅ **Fix Dispatch Token & launch flow** — Make sure launch URL works *in TalentLMS* and doesn’t 403.

But **none of that can happen** if you can’t upload a course.
