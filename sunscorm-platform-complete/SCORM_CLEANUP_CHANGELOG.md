# SCORM Pipeline Cleanup & Hardening - Changelog

**Date**: January 19, 2025  
**Objective**: Complete cleanup, consolidation, and hardening of SCORM pipeline from upload to dispatch

## ‚úÖ MAJOR FIXES COMPLETED

### 1. Route Modularization & Duplication Removal
- **FIXED**: Split 2098-line routes.ts into clean domain-specific modules:
  - `server/routes/launch.ts` - SCORM launch and external LMS integration
  - `server/routes/courses.ts` - Course management, upload, preview, editing
  - `server/routes/dispatches.ts` - Dispatch creation, management, export
  - `server/routes/upload.ts` - Chunked upload system for large files
- **REMOVED**: All duplicate logic across route handlers
- **CONSOLIDATED**: ZIP parsing, SCORM validation, and launch generation into services

### 2. Service Layer Implementation
- **NEW**: `server/services/scormService.ts` - Universal SCORM handling with caching
  - Consolidated ZIP extraction with 30-minute TTL cache
  - Universal SCORM entry point detection (removed duplicates)
  - Mobile-responsive SCORM launch HTML generation
  - Enhanced content-type detection for all file types
- **NEW**: `server/services/launchService.ts` - Universal launch file generation
  - Single template injection system (removed duplicates)
  - Enhanced domain detection for production deployment
  - Comprehensive permission and validation checks
  - Proper soft delete enforcement at launch level

### 3. Enhanced SCORM Standards Support
