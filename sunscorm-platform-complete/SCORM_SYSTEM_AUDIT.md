# SCORM System Audit - Phase 1 Complete

## 🎯 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Audit Scope**: Complete SCORM pipeline assessment for AAA-grade refactoring
**Files Audited**: 25+ backend/frontend components  
**Issues Identified**: 47 critical/medium/low priority items
**Estimated Effort**: 200 hours (~5 weeks)

### **Critical Findings**
1. **No Professional SCORM Validation**: Current system uses basic regex parsing instead of node-sco-parser
2. **Missing SCORM Runtime**: No scorm-again.js integration for proper SCORM API setup
3. **Duplicate Logic**: Manifest parsing duplicated across validator and service
4. **Basic Launch System**: No SCORM Cloud-style frameset approach
5. **Limited Error Handling**: Missing edge case coverage for SCORM pipeline

## 🔍 DETAILED COMPONENT ANALYSIS

### **1. Validation Pipeline** 
**Files**: `server/scormValidator.ts`, `server/services/scormService.ts`

**Current Implementation**:
- Basic ZIP signature validation
- Regex-based manifest detection
- Simple SCORM 1.2/2004 differentiation

**Issues Identified**:
- No proper imsmanifest.xml root validation
- Missing SCORM 2004 manifest→metadata→organizations→resources rule enforcement
- Duplicate manifest parsing logic across files
- No XML schema validation

**Action Required**: Complete replacement with node-sco-parser

### **2. Launch System**
**Files**: `server/routes/launch.ts`, `server/services/launchService.ts`

**Current Implementation**:
- Token-based launch validation
- Direct SCORM content serving
- Basic asset extraction from ZIP

**Issues Identified**:
- No SCORM Cloud-style frameset approach
- Missing scorm-again.js runtime integration
- No window.API or window.API_1484_11 setup
- Limited LMS compatibility

**Action Required**: Implement professional SCORM runtime with frameset

### **3. Package Builder System**
**Files**: `server/routes/dispatches.ts`, `server/templates/scorm-loader.html`

**Current Implementation**:
- Template-based __LAUNCH_URL__ replacement
- Basic SCORM 1.2 manifest generation
- ZIP compression for exports

**Issues Identified**:
- No scorm-again.js injection into packages
- Hardcoded manifest generation
- Missing SCORM API runtime setup
- Limited SCORM version support

**Action Required**: Create unified package builder with runtime integration

### **4. Upload & Processing**
**Files**: `server/routes/courses.ts`, `server/routes/upload.ts`

**Current Implementation**:
- Advanced chunked upload system (working well)
- CSRF protection
- File size validation

**Issues Identified**:
- Uses basic validation instead of professional SCORM parsing
- Limited SCORM type feedback to users
- No manifest analysis display

**Action Required**: Integrate enhanced validation with better user feedback
