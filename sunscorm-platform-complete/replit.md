### Complete SCORM Pipeline Fix (Jan 19, 2025)
**CRITICAL RESOLUTION**: Fixed all major SCORM upload, preview, and launch pipeline issues:
1. **Upload System Fixes**: 
   - Resolved 413 Payload Too Large errors by implementing 512MB upload limits
   - Fixed CSRF token validation for multipart file uploads
   - Enhanced cross-device file storage using copyFile+unlink approach
2. **Launch System Overhaul**: 
   - **CRITICAL**: Fixed `/launch/:token` route that was returning JSON instead of SCORM content
   - Replaced JSON responses with proper SCORM HTML pages that serve actual course content
   - Added `/launch/:token/assets/*` route for serving individual SCORM files from ZIP packages
   - Implemented full SCORM 1.2 API with real xAPI tracking for progress monitoring

### Fixed Dispatch Creation Issues (Jan 19, 2025)
**CRITICAL FIX**: Resolved dispatch creation failures caused by:
1. **Database Schema Issues**: Fixed UUID generation using literal string instead of SQL function 
   - Changed `default("gen_random_uuid()")` to `default(sql\`gen_random_uuid()\`)` in schema
   - Added missing `launch_token` field to dispatches table
2. **Disabled Dispatch Logic**: Fixed blocked re-dispatch to companies with previously disabled dispatches
   - Updated `findActiveDispatch()` to only check non-disabled dispatches
   - Enhanced company profile to show Active vs Disabled dispatch status with dates
   - Added info banner in CreateDispatch form when re-dispatching previously disabled courses
3. **API Enhancements**: Added courseId filtering support for better UX
   - Updated `/api/dispatches` endpoint to support `courseId`, `tenantId`, and `includeDisabled` parameters

**Key Principle**: Disabled dispatches are historical receipts, not blockers for new dispatches.

### SCORM ZIP Export Implementation (Jan 19, 2025)
**CRITICAL UPGRADE**: Replaced HTML-only dispatch downloads with fully SCORM-compliant ZIP packages:
1. **Backend Implementation**: 
   - New `/api/dispatches/:id/export` endpoint generates SCORM ZIP archives
   - ZIP contains: `imsmanifest.xml` (SCORM 1.2 manifest), `index.html` (professional loader), and `dispatch.json` (metadata)
   - Uses archiver package for in-memory ZIP generation with maximum compression
   - Professional SCORM loader template with progress animations and error handling
2. **Frontend Updates**: 
   - Updated all dispatch download buttons to export SCORM packages instead of HTML files
   - Modified dispatches.tsx, company-profile.tsx, and tenants.tsx pages
   - Improved user messaging: "Export SCORM Package" instead of "Download Launch File"
3. **System Integration**:
   - Launch route validates disabled dispatches (returns 403 error)
   - xAPI statements respect disabled dispatch status
   - Global search excludes disabled dispatches by default
   - Dashboard stats exclude disabled dispatches from counts
4. **SCORM Compliance & Loader Fix**:
   - Minimal SCORM 1.2 manifest structure for maximum LMS compatibility
   - Professional loader template that doesn't rely on postMessage communication
   - Launch URL injected directly into loader HTML during ZIP generation
   - Supports all major LMS platforms (TalentLMS, Docebo, Cornerstone, etc.)
   - Error handling for JavaScript-disabled environments with manual launch fallback

**Key Benefit**: Dispatches work seamlessly in any SCORM-compliant LMS without external dependencies

**Technical Fix**: Resolved postMessage dependency issue where loaders expected `launch_url` from parent window

### SCORM Launch URL Fix for External LMS Deployment (Jan 19, 2025)

2. **Course Cards Enhancement**: 
   - Added "Preview Course" button to dropdown menu on course cards
   - Eye icon with intuitive navigation to preview route
   - Positioned before "Edit Course" for logical workflow
3. **Backend SCORM Serving**:
   - `/api/preview/:courseId` route generates SCORM preview HTML with embedded runtime
   - `/api/preview/:courseId/assets/*` route extracts and serves individual files from ZIP
   - Automatic SCORM entry point detection (index.html, story.html, etc.)
   - Full ZIP extraction using yauzl with comprehensive file type support
4. **SCORM Runtime Simulation**:

1. **Environment Variable Validation**: 
   - Added startup validation for critical environment variables (PORT, DATABASE_URL, SESSION_SECRET, REPLIT_DOMAINS)
   - Production mode requires all critical vars; development mode shows warnings with fallbacks
   - Enhanced logging of environment status on server startup
2. **Authentication Graceful Degradation**:
   - Modified auth setup to handle missing REPLIT_DOMAINS without crashing
   - Production deployment validates SESSION_SECRET requirement
