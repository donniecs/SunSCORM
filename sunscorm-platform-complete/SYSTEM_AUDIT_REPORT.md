### Medium-Term Goals
1. Implement remaining SCORM standards (2004, AICC)
2. Add automated testing pipeline
3. Create API key authentication system
4. Build webhook notification system
5. Implement horizontal scaling

### Long-Term Vision
1. Mobile application development

## Conclusion

The Sun-SCORM platform demonstrates a solid foundation with professional architecture and implementation. The system successfully handles the core SCORM dispatch workflow with proper security, multi-tenancy, and licensing controls. While there are areas for improvement, particularly in testing and documentation, the platform is production-ready for its current feature set and shows clear potential for competing with established solutions like SCORM Cloud.
